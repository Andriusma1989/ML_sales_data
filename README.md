# ML Sales data

The dataset used in this project has two features (age and estimated salary) and a binary target variable
In this project, we used GridSearchCV with k-fold cross-validation to find the best parameters for three different models: K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The best parameters were chosen based on their ability to maximize the accuracy of the models. The optimal parameters found for each model can be attributed to various factors, such as the data distribution, shape, and decision boundary.
